# Quasheng-UV-5k-UK-North-West-Codeplug
Quasheng UV-K5 within the North West UK Region. 
So here is my codeplug for Quasheng UV-K5 within the North West UK Region. This is unfinished and still under development. It holds the channels for UK PMR Channels 1 - 16, 2 Meter Amateur Band Simplex Channels, 70CM Simplex Channels, Repeaters and Gateways within 50 Miles of Wigan, Greater Manchester. It also holds the receive frequencies for a few local airports namely Manchester, Barton Aerodrome(City Airport) and Liverpool.
