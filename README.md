# Quasheng-UV-k5-UK-North-West-Channel Settings File
Quasheng UV-K5 within the North West UK Region. 
So  here is my updated channel settings file for Quasheng UV-K5 for use within the North West UK Region. 
This is still a work in progress. 
It holds the channels for UK PMR Channels 1 - 16, 2 Meter Amateur Band  Simplex Channels, 70CM Simplex Channels, Repeaters and Gateways within 50 Miles of Wigan, Greater Manchester. 
I have added channels for the ISS Voice Repeater and SSTV.
It also holds the receive frequencies for a few local airports namely Manchester, Barton Aerodrome(City Airport), Liverpool, Blackpool, Hawarden,Warton and Woodvale.
